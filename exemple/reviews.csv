2022-07-18,Thor: Love and Thunder,2022,,,,"How can you make a crappier movie with such a big budget? Marvel becomes a disaster on wheels. Fortunately, Christian Bale is there to perf",,2022-07-17
2022-07-18,The Monuments Men,2014,,4,,"An interesting and enjoyable film, with a light but historical tone. Very good and entertaining",,2022-07-18
2022-07-19,Malcolm & Marie,2021,,4,,"A very interesting film, with a couple arguing and criticizing cinema for almost 2 hours. The duo works perfectly. First film in black and white and very happy. Interesting ideas and milliliterate music. Lots of close-ups. The film tries to ask questions about cinema, should there always be a message, Real's intention, was moolight's Real legitimate to talk about homosexuality? A good experience!",,2022-07-18
2022-07-22,BlacKkKlansman,2018,,4,,"A film I really liked, very true to life, with an interesting element of humor and lightness, while at the same time portraying heavy and important aspects. Good dialogue, very cool pace throughout. A film that makes you think about following an ideology or a figure.",,2022-07-21
2022-07-24,The Gray Man,2022,,2.5,,"Very cool cast, unfortunately the film remains average. The plot isn't really developed, fighting all the way through the film for a few things and in the end doing nothing with them? No revolutionary ideas, but some pretty cool scenes: plane, street, .... Ryan's character would have deserved more focus on the ghost aspect.",,2022-07-23
2022-07-24,Sorry to Bother You,2018,,5,,"Film tr√®s dr√¥le, la critique est tr√®s pr√©sente bien qu'un peu grosse. Pas mal de Vibe de la s√©rie Atlanta dans la Real et m√™me dans les acteurs (normal). Faite juste gaffe il prend une tournure inattendue",,2022-07-24
2022-07-30,The Big Short,2015,,3,,"Film a little long, I didn't understand everything because I don't know anything about finance, so it's quickly complicated to explain the reason for an economic crisis. However, the film does try with some very funny interludes that keep you hooked. I didn't find Christian Bale at his best, but overall the actors are cool. Good entertainment in real terms, but the film can quickly lose you.",,2022-07-30
2022-08-09,The Usual Suspects,1995,,3.5,,A crime/mafia film I really enjoyed,,2022-08-08
2022-08-25,Ambulance,2022,,2,,"I couldn't even finish it. But I usually like Beau, and I liked the Transformers quite a bit. But here we don't have useless shots, drones that serve no purpose, cuts that make you puke. The script is shaky at the end, in short, I really didn't like it.",,2022-08-24
2022-08-25,Constantine: The House of Mystery,2022,,3,,"Showcase that ends the arc of the dc animated universe. The DC animated films are so underwhelming, I loved them all. DC managed to set up a better universe in its animated films than Marvel did in its movies. And then there's batmans >>>>",,2022-08-24
2022-08-26,Lady Bird,2017,,4,,"I loved the film. I was afraid it would turn into an awkward teenage movie, but at no point did it do the right thing. Well, Timoth√©e Chalamet as a dark character is weird haha. But otherwise a really cool film, incredible character development and the lead actress plays it very, very well.",,2022-08-26
2022-09-05,Decision to Leave,2022,,4,,"J'ai vraiment bien aim√©. Une intrigue original. On reconna√Æt l'attention de chaque d√©tail. La bo du film m'a pas mal marqu√© aussi. Des nuits hant√©es par des affaires non r√©solus, et la lib√©ration de ses d√©mons marqu√© par le sourire de la fin. Le film peut √™tre cependant complexe a comprendre parfois",,2022-09-04
2022-09-06,Sink or Swim,2018,,4,,"A feel-good movie, the story is really cool and also brings to light subjects like depression and virility. I found it touching and, frankly, the actors are strong.",,2022-09-06
2022-09-16,Everything Everywhere All at Once,2022,,5,,"A film that almost touches on the superhero. Perfectly balanced between humor and seriousness. There are poignant moments where no humor is involved, and other moments that are totally zany but don't take us out of the film. A masterful director, actors (‚ù§Ô∏è). It's a film that does things well and doesn't take itself too seriously. Here's hoping for a new breath of this style as Marvel continues to sink a little more with each film.",,2022-09-15
2022-09-16,Three Thousand Years of Longing,2022,,4,,"I really liked the settings, the stories and the history. The duo works very well and I was carried away by the accounts.",,2022-09-15
2023-10-31,The Creator,2023,,4,,"A film that falls perfectly into what I like: the universe, the atmosphere, the actors. Well, the story's clearly not perfect and there are a lot of grey areas, but frankly, the visuals are really beautiful.",,2023-10-30
2023-11-07,Lord of War,2005,,3,,"Seen at Louis's, a pleasant film, Real has some good ideas and the story is easy to get caught up in!",,2023-11-07
2023-12-16,Cha Cha Real Smooth,2022,,4.5,,"Some films are just there to comfort you and help you move on because you identify a little too much, but this is one of them.",,2023-12-15

2024-02-21,"Oslo, August 31st",2011,,4,,"2nd Joachim Trier film I've seen (I'm missing Reprise). The subjects are as well dealt with as ever, but it's still hard to watch because you really feel immersed in this lack of feeling and emotion, you can feel the emptiness and surrender. All the wobbly reactions, advice and discussions. Even in the realization of what he misses most, he feels nothing but disgust (bonus for the city shots).",,2024-02-20
2024-02-22,You Were Never Really Here,2017,,4,,"Phoenix trop fort, la musique trop fort (dans les 2 sens), tous est bas√© sur la folie et la musique aide √©norm√©ment, on remet toujours en question ce que l'ont voit. Au final tr√®s peu de sc√®ne d'extr√™me violence mais tout le climat du film est violent parce qu'il nous laisse comprendre, c'√©tait vraiment d√©sagr√©able comme sensation mdr",,2024-02-21

2024-09-10,Columbus,2017,,3,,"I was a little disappointed, I probably had too many expectations of this film, but it's a very beautiful film, and there was probably little missing for me to fully appreciate it, certainly a more present and memorable soundtrack. However, I still love films about people in search of meaning and definition. These wandering characters who are transformed by a harmless encounter, surely I'm watching too much film? Yes",,2024-09-10

2024-10-21,Melancholia,2011,,1.5,,"basically, i didn't like the film, i'm sure it's lars von trier's masterpiece, but this shaky camera that moves h24 makes me puke (i only caught the still shots during the apocalypse scenes) and then the message, THE MESSAGE, no my reuf life is worth living, death is not liberation (in short I'm revolted, it will surely mature with time, but it's a really pessimistic and sick vision of life (not so surprising as he made the film after a depression)",,2024-10-21

2024-11-15,Anora,2024,,4,,"What can I say about this film? Very happy to have seen it at the cinema, the actors are really hypnotic The film literally makes you go through all the feelings, from laughter to the desire to fuck yourself in the air, it constantly juggles with the too much but it stays just right. I'm a bit confused really, but I think I really liked it.",,2024-11-14

2025-03-26,Captain America: Brave New World,2025,,2,,"So much wasted potential, I'm bored, it had all the makings of a good film, but some of the fights are soft (especially the down-to-earth ones, like just bare hands) and others you just can't believe. There was enough to make the snake as stylish as Bucky in Captain America 2. Otherwise there are some good surprises but I don't know, I don't really believe in them.",,2025-03-25

The film is a bit long on some points, the love story is a bit rushed but the charisma of the actors, even the leper king, frankly the characters have a presence.
